    <h4>Explanation</h4>
    <p>This dataset shows the relationship between activewear brands and online retailers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each node represents one brand</li>
        <li>Brands are linked together if they are sold in the same retailer.</li>
        <li>Node size represents the number of retailers that sell that particular brand</li>
        <li>Brands with the same color are sold by the same retailer(s)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interesting observations</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are a couple of clusters of brands that are sold by only one retailer (Sears and JCPenny)</li>
        <li>A few brands are sold by many retailers (Nike, Under Armour, Adidas)</li>
        <li>Many brands are sold only by one retailer, usually the owner of the brand</li>
    </ul>
